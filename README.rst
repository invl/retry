An easy to use retry decorator.

This package is a fork from the [`retry`](https://github.com/invl/retry) package, but with some of added community-sourced features.


## Features

From original `retry`:
- Retry on specific exceptions.
- Set a maximum number of retries.
- Set a delay between retries.
- Set a maximum delay between retries.
- Set backoff and jitter parameters.
- Use a custom logger.
- No external dependencies (stdlib only).
- (Optionally) Preserve function signatures (`pip install decorator`).

New features in `reretry`:
- Log traceback of an error that lead to a failed attempt.
- Call a custom callback after each failed attempt.
- Can be used with async functions.


## Installation

```bash
$ pip install reretry
```

## API
### The @retry decorator

#### Usage
`@retry(exceptions=Exception, tries=-1, delay=0, max_delay=None, backoff=1, jitter=0, show_traceback=False, logger=logging_logger, fail_callback=None, condition=threading.Condition())`

#### Arguments
- `exceptions`: An exception or a tuple of exceptions to catch. Default: Exception.

- `tries`: The maximum number of attempts. default: -1 (infinite).

- `delay`: Initial delay between attempts (in seconds). default: 0.

- `max_delay`: The maximum value of delay (in seconds). default: None (no limit).

- `backoff`: Multiplier applied to delay between attempts. default: 1 (no backoff).

- `jitter`: Extra seconds added to delay between attempts. default: 0. Fixed if a number, random if a range tuple (min, max).

- `show_traceback`: Print traceback before retrying (Python3 only). default: False.

- `logger`: `logger.warning(fmt, error, delay)` will be called on failed attempts. default: retry.logging_logger. if None, logging is disabled.

- `fail_callback`: `fail_callback(e)` will be called after failed attempts.
- `condition`: `condition` is a construct that has ...acquire / ...release 
and ...wait(n_seconds)


#### Examples
```python
from reretry import retry

@retry()
def make_trouble():
    '''Retry until succeeds'''

@retry()
async def async_make_trouble():
    '''Retry an async function until it succeeds'''

@retry(ZeroDivisionError, tries=3, delay=2)
def make_trouble():
    '''Retry on ZeroDivisionError, raise error after 3 attempts,
    sleep 2 seconds between attempts.'''

@retry((ValueError, TypeError), delay=1, backoff=2)
def make_trouble():
    '''Retry on ValueError or TypeError, sleep 1, 2, 4, 8, ... seconds between attempts.'''

@retry((ValueError, TypeError), delay=1, backoff=2, max_delay=4)
def make_trouble():
    '''Retry on ValueError or TypeError, sleep 1, 2, 4, 4, ... seconds between attempts.'''

@retry(ValueError, delay=1, jitter=1)
def make_trouble():
    '''Retry on ValueError, sleep 1, 2, 3, 4, ... seconds between attempts.'''

def callback(e: Exception):
    '''Print error message'''
    print(e)

@retry(ValueError, fail_callback=callback):
def make_trouble():
    '''Retry on ValueError, between attempts call callback(e)
    (where e is the Exception raised).'''

# If you enable logging, you can get warnings like 'ValueError, retrying in
# 1 seconds'
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig()
    make_trouble()
```

### The `retry_call` function
Calls a function and re-executes it if it failed.

This is very similar to the decorator, except that it takes a function and its arguments as parameters. The use case behind it is to be able to dynamically adjust the retry arguments.

#### Usage
`retry_call(f, fargs=None, fkwargs=None, exceptions=Exception, tries=-1, delay=0, max_delay=None, backoff=1, jitter=0, show_traceback=False, logger=logging_logger, fail_callback=None, condition=threading.Condition())`

#### Example
```python
import requests

from reretry.api import retry_call


def make_trouble(service, info=None):
    if not info:
        info = ''
    r = requests.get(service + info)
    return r.text


def what_is_my_ip(approach=None):
    if approach == "optimistic":
        tries = 1
    elif approach == "conservative":
        tries = 3
    else:
        # skeptical
        tries = -1
    result = retry_call(
        make_trouble,
        fargs=["http://ipinfo.io/"],
        fkwargs={"info": "ip"},
        tries=tries
    )
    print(result)

what_is_my_ip("conservative")
```
